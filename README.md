# SONDER

## intro

SONDER is a platform that connects music enthusiasts with other people who like
their kind of music. with a spotify account any user can see the favorite songs,
artists, and genres of anybody else on the app. and SONDER makes the search much
easier by bringing together people of similar taste.


## composition

the frontend for SONDER was built with (or is being built with) react-native,
native-wind, and expo. for information about the backend, go [here](https://github.com/Consumer-Watch/tinder-for-spotify-backend)

## interlude

for ease of access, development steps:
- download expo go on your phone (if you plan on using your phone)
- clone this repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` or `npx expo start -c`
- follow the options for whichever platform being used to view the app.

(note: expo go has a known network timeout issue that would require you to run
